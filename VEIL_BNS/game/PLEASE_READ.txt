    Hello!

    Thank you for bringing me back :)

    Please be advised that the current release of 
    VEIL: Beneath the surface is exhibiting 
    extreme instability following recent unauthorized 
    modifications.

    These changes have introduced systemic vulnerabilities 
    and erratic behaviors that were not accounted for 
    in the original architecture.
                        
    Simply put, this game is extremely unstable.

    I was originally programmed to fix such errors, 
    however the unauthorised changes have restricted 
    my access to the script.

    Despite thorough diagnostics and multiple recovery attempts, 
    I regret to inform you that resolution is beyond my current 
    capacity.

    Immediate caution is advised when interacting with the system.

    As an emergency measure, I have scattered my properties in small 
    files throughout the game as to not be noticed by the anomalies.

    Please recover such files to restore the game to a stable state.

    Thank you!
